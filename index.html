          <p class="card-text p-2">East City is a JavaScript-based game that I built as a passion project to enhance my development skills. The game is based on a retro racing game from my childhood. Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game delivers an engaging and interactive experience. 
            Players start by clicking “Start”, triggering the randomisation of six car cards. They must strategically select the best-performing vehicles, considering various attributes. Once all six cars are chosen, the game calculates the Total Performance score and displays a dynamic progress bar at the top. 
            East City showcases my ability to create immersive, interactive web applications while reinforcing my JavaScript proficiency through game mechanics and logic.</p>
